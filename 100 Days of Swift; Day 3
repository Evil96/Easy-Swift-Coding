//Arithmetic operators

let total = firstScore + secondScore //sum
let difference = firstScore - secondScore //difference

let product = firstScore * secondScore //mult
let divided = firstScore / secondScore //division

let remainder = 13 % secondScore //mod

//Operator Overloading
//What an operator does depends on the values you use it with
let halfName = ["Ed"]
let otherHalf = ["gar"]
let sumName = halfName + otherHalf
//Swift won't let you mix types

//Compund asigment operators
var score = 45
score += 15

var ad = "I've got a peanut in my"
ad += " butter"

//Comparison operators
let firsttScore = 6
let seconddScore = 4

firsttScore == seconddScore //equals
firsttScore != seconddScore //is not equal

firstScore < secondScore //minus
firstScore >= secondScore //greater or equal

"Edgar" <= "Holland" //Comparison operators also work with strings

//Conditions
let firstCard = 11
let secondCard = 10

//first example condition
if firstCard + secondCard == 21 {
    print("Blackjack!")
}

//Second
if firstCard + secondCard == 21 {
    print("Blackjack!")
} else {
    print("Regular cards")
}

//third
if firstCard + secondCard == 2 {
    print("Aces!")
} else if firstCard + secondCard == 21 {
    print("Blackjack!")
} else {
    print("Regular cards")
}

//Combining conditions
let age1 = 12
let age2 = 21

if age1 > 18 && age2 > 18 {
    print("Both are over 18")
} //As one of both conditions wasn't true, it doesn't print

//So we can use OR to print even if one of the conditions weren't true
if age1 > 18 || age2 > 18 {
    print("One of them is over 18")
}

//The ternary operator
let card = 11
let cardTwo = 10        //if it's true           If it's false
print(card == cardTwo ? "Cards are the same" : "Cards are different")

//Which is the same as:

if card == cardTwo {
    print("Cards are the same")
} else {
    print("Cards are different")
